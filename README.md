# React Native Country Picker üó∫Ô∏è

A country picker component for React Native. This is a fork of [xcarpentier/react-native-country-picker-modal](https://github.com/xcarpentier/react-native-country-picker-modal) with some improvements. This is following an approach similar to [shadcn/ui](https://github.com/shadcn-ui/ui) approach to give you the power to customise the component as you want. It will live with the components that created by you. So no more need to wait for the maintainer to accept your PR or patch the node modules.

## Installation

```bash
$ npm install @callstack/react-theme-provider fuse.js react-async-hook
```
